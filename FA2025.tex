\begin{abstract}
% In computational bioacoustics, deep learning models are composed of feature extractors and classifiers. 
% The feature extractors generate vector representations of the input sound segments, called embeddings. 
% The classifiers recognize a fixed number of classes most commonly representing different animal species. 
% Various benchmarks have been published to evaluate the classification performance. 
% While such benchmarking provides insight into specific performance statistics, it is limited to species that are included in the models training data. Furthermore, it makes it impossible to compare models trained on very different taxonomic groups. 
% This paper aims to address this gap by analyzing the generated embeddings of more than 15 bioacoustic models spanning a wide range of setups (model architectures, training data, training paradigms). 
% We investigate and evaluate different ways to quantify how models structure embedding spaces, which allows us to focus our comparison on feature extractors independent of classifiers. 
% We believe that this approach lets us evaluate the adaptability and generalization potential of models going beyond the classes they were trained on.

While benchmarking of classification scores provides insight into specific performance statistics, it is limited to species that are included in the models training data. Furthermore, it makes it impossible to compare models trained on very different taxonomic groups. 
This paper aims to address this gap by analyzing the embeddings generated by the feature extractors of 15 bioacoustic models spanning a wide range of setups (model architectures, training data, training paradigms). 
We evaluate and compare different ways how models structure embedding spaces through clustering and kNN classification, which allows us to focus our comparison on feature extractors independent of their classifiers. 
We believe that this approach lets us evaluate the adaptability and generalization potential of models going beyond the classes they were trained on.
